I'll help you commit your code to GitHub. First, let me check if there's a Git repository already initialized in your workspace.

I can see that you already have a Git repository initialized (`.git` directory exists) and a `.gitignore` file. Here are the steps to commit your code to GitHub:

1. First, make sure you have a GitHub repository created. If you haven't created one yet, go to GitHub.com and create a new repository.

2. If this is your first time pushing to this repository, you'll need to add the remote repository. Run this command in your terminal:
```bash
git remote add origin <your-github-repository-url>
```

3. Then, follow these steps to commit and push your code:

```bash
# Stage all your changes
git add .

# Create a commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Push to GitHub (if this is your first time pushing to main branch)
git push -u origin main
```

If you're working on a different branch, replace `main` with your branch name.

Some additional tips:
- Make sure you have Git configured with your name and email:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```
- If you're pushing to GitHub for the first time, you might need to authenticate. GitHub now uses personal access tokens instead of passwords for command-line authentication. You can create one in GitHub Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens.

Would you like me to help you with any specific part of this process?
