_**Assistant**_

I'll help you commit your code to GitHub. First, let me check if there's a Git repository already initialized in your workspace.

I can see that you already have a Git repository initialized (`.git` directory exists) and a `.gitignore` file. Here are the steps to commit your code to GitHub:

1. First, make sure you have a GitHub repository created. If you haven't created one yet, go to GitHub.com and create a new repository.

2. If this is your first time pushing to this repository, you'll need to add the remote repository. Run this command in your terminal:
```bash
git remote add origin <your-github-repository-url>
```

3. Then, follow these steps to commit and push your code:

```bash
# Stage all your changes
git add .

# Create a commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Push to GitHub (if this is your first time pushing to main branch)
git push -u origin main
```

If you're working on a different branch, replace `main` with your branch name.

Some additional tips:
- Make sure you have Git configured with your name and email:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```
- If you're pushing to GitHub for the first time, you might need to authenticate. GitHub now uses personal access tokens instead of passwords for command-line authentication. You can create one in GitHub Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens.

Would you like me to help you with any specific part of this process?

I'm getting the folloing error, help fix it.Build Error

_**Assistant**_

This error occurs because the `openai` package is not installed in your project. Let me help you fix this by installing the required package.

First, let me check your package.json to see if the dependency is listed:


---

Read file: package.json

---

I can see that the `openai` package is actually listed in your dependencies (version ^4.100.0), but it seems it hasn't been installed properly. Let's fix this by reinstalling the package.

Since you're using pnpm (I can see a `pnpm-lock.yaml` file), run this command in your terminal:

```bash
pnpm install openai
```

If that doesn't work, you can try:

```bash
pnpm install
```

This will reinstall all dependencies, including the `openai` package.

After running either of these commands, the error should be resolved. The error occurred because while the package was listed in your `package.json`, it wasn't actually installed in your `node_modules` directory.

If you're still seeing the error after running these commands, try:
1. Delete the `node_modules` folder
2. Delete `pnpm-lock.yaml`
3. Run `pnpm install` again

Let me know if you're still experiencing issues after trying these steps!

zsh: command not found: pnpm

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I see the issue. You don't have `pnpm` installed on your system. Let's install it first. Since you're on macOS (I can see from your system info), you can install pnpm using one of these methods:

1. Using npm (if you have Node.js installed):
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

2. Using Homebrew (recommended for macOS):
```bash
brew install pnpm
```

After installing pnpm, you can then run:
```bash
pnpm install
```

If you don't have Node.js installed yet, you'll need to install that first. You can do this by:

1. Installing Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/
2. Or using Homebrew:
```bash
brew install node
```

Let me know which method you'd prefer to use, and I'll help you with the next steps!
